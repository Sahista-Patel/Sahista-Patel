### Hi there 👋

Holding 4+ experience 👩‍💻 with Automation, I believe employee satisfaction and engagement are vital to any organization.

My automation scripts can save employees valuable time ⏲ from manual/repetitive tasks and employers from bottlenecks along with human-errors. I’m looking to develop similar scripts using my specialties in Python, Powershell, Java, C/C++ and logic building strategies that can stop the people from changing into robots 🤖 parallelly provide high-efficiency and throughput rates for an organization.

I’m currently learning 🌱 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts.
